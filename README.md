# Pokedex App

This is a little "for-fun" app I built using the following technologies:

- Next.js (for site building with React, along with SSG and other goodies)
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- TailwindCSS for styling

The data from this site comes from the Open PokeAPI, and images come from Veekun. I claim no commercial/intellectual rights to these data sets, just merely using them to create something neat and learn about some cool tools.
