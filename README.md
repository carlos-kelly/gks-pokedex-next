# Pokedex App

This is a little "for-fun" app I built using the following technologies:

- Next.js (for site building with React, along with SSG and other goodies)
- Framer Motion (for animations)
- TailwindCSS for styling

__I do not own any of the data used in this site.__ I sourced the pokemon data from the following sources:

- The general pokemon data came from [The Open Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).
- The general Pokemon images came from [Veekun](https://veekun.com/dex/media/).
- The TCG card data and images came from [Pokemon TCG Developers](https://pokemontcg.io/).

The data from this site comes from the Open PokeAPI, and images come from Veekun. I claim no commercial/intellectual rights to these data sets, just merely using them to create something neat and learn about some cool tools.
